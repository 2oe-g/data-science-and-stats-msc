    "\n",
    "Here, an 80%/20% split is initiated, with 80% of the dataset being assigned as the training set and 20% as the test set. This process is fairly easy using `scikit-learn`. In general `train_test_split` is implemented with the specified split proportions and a random state; if a random state is not specified, its default state is **None** which results in `train_test_split` returning different results for each execution. Hence, below, `random_state` is set to 0 (can also be set to any random integer) in order to ensure the same results are returned for each and every execution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Futhermore, `CountVectorizer` is instantiated after the split, in order to vectorize `x_train` and `x_test`. **Recall** that vectorization is the general process of turning a collection of text documents into numerical feature vectors. `x_train` is fitted and transformed (`.fit_transform`) whereas `x_test` is only transformed (`.transform`). The difference in vectorization methods is particularly important as this distinction allows one to avoid **data leakage**. More specifically, fitting the test set is **ALWAYS** avoided in order to reduce bias and provide a more accurate estimate of how the model is performing on the test set.\n",

    "### Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that only the training data has been used up to the point where the model has been trained, the Multinomial Naive Bayers classifier is implemented using the training data. By use of laplace smoothing, this of which is a default feature of `MultinomialNB()`, the problem of zero probability, where words that appear in the test set but not in the training set, is handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "After creation of the confusion matrix using `confusion_matrix`, its visualisation is completed here in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* using `ConfusionMatrixDisplay` which allows for distinctions between the number of True Negatives, False Positives, False Negatives and True Positives\n",
    "* using `sns.heatmap` which improves on some aspects of the previous visualisation but requires a bit more coding; the proportion of True Negatives, False Positives, False Negatives and True Positives are clearly displayed in the form of percentages as well as labelled accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NB**: as a general rule of thumb, a desirable confusion matrix is one with a low amount of False Positives and False Negatives, and a high amount of True Negatives and True Positives. In other words, we want to reduce the occurrence of Type I and Type II errors in the proposed model.\n",

    "### Improving Our Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach taken in task 1 makes use of a uni-gram model, this of which analyses each individual word independently, rather than phrases. For example, under a uni-gram classifier, the phrase \"I am not happy\", once tokenized, would be regarded as a positive sentiment due to the presence of the word \"happy\". However, the reality is that this phrase has a negative cognitation, this of which is unfortunately missed by uni-gram classifiers. We can improve on the uni-gram classifier and its downfall in sentiment analysis by implementing a n-gram classifier instead. N-grams, such as bigrams and trigrams, consider words in groups of two and three, respectively, thus allowing for sentimental implementations to be more accurately represented in the model. Using our previous example, \"I am not happy\" would be correctly classified as negative using a bigram model which considers the phrase \"not happy\", thus improving model accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, perplexity is utilised as the metric for evaluating language models. The perplexity of a language model on a test set is the inverse probability of the test set, normalized by the number of words. In general, minimizing perplexity is equivalent to maximizing the test set probability according to the language model. Keeping in mind that the perplexity of two language models is only comparable if they use identical vocabularies, through previous research, it can be seen that the n-grams approach does indeed improve on classifier accuracy, but to a certain extent. In one study, unigram and bigram models run on a test set of 1.5 million words showed that perplexity decreases significantly from 962 under the unigram model, to 170 under the bigram model, hence implying greater accuracy using the latter model **[1]**. This notion is further supported by other studies which concluded that bigram models are particularly advantageous and useful once run on very large datasets **[2]** **[3]**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As n-gram length increases, there might not always be increased accuracy; more specifically test performance will increase to a certain point (n) and decrease with increasing n afterwards. This is usually the case with sparse data, in which there is a relatively large amount of token types but each of these types has a very low frequency **[4]**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all of the above in mind, I will implement the following n-gram models, in order to analyse any improvements in performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* bigram only model (expected to show some improvement)\n",
    "* trigram only model (expected to show decreased performance due to presence of sparse data)\n",
    "* unigram and bigram model (expected to show most improvement as we consider individual words as well as pairs)\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure is generally the same, the only difference being that we now use `CountVectorizer` to specify the n-gram range to be used. For example, `ngram_range`=(2,2) indicates a bigram model whereas `ngram_range`=(1,2) indicates a unigram and bigram model; by default `ngram_range`=(1,1).\n",

    "## Comparison of Task 1 Approach (Unigram) vs Task 2 Approach (N-gram)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the aforementioned expectations have indeed been met. In particular, the unigram and bigram approach resulted in the most improvement, increasing classifier performance from 75.45% seen in the initial unigram model to 78.7% on the test set (+ 3.25%). Likewise, the bigram only approach increased performance to 77.62% (+ 2.17%) whereas the trigram only approach saw a decreased performance of 68.95% (- 6.50%). \n",
    "\n",
    "Directly correlating to this improved performance, it can be observed that the proportion of False Positives and False Negatives did in fact decrease in both the bigram only and unigram and bigram models. This can possibly be explained by the previous example, where a negative sentiment may have been mistakenly considered as a positive sentiment, under the unigram only model. Conversely, decreased performance of the trigram approach relates to the increased proportion of same. In this case, this decrease was hypothesised due to the **sparsity** of the provided dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there was not a relatively significant improvement, it was still observed up to n = 2. It was noted in the previous section that the bigram approach sees better results on larger datasets, thus making it logically possible that not much improvement was seen due to the **size** of the provided dataset. \n",
