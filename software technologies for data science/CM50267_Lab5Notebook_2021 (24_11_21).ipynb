    "Option 1: Demonstrate it to a tutor in the lab session. They will record that the code behaves correctly and you will receive the mark. You *must* also upload it to moodle by the lab deadline. No marks will be given if it is not uploaded, even if the tutor has checked the code. This is the fastest way to get feedback, and ensure that you will get the marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 2: Upload the code to moodle by the lab deadline. It will be marked online using an additional dataset. This will be a slower process and you run the risk that even though your code produced the output below, there is a bug that will be demonstrated by the use of a different dataset.\n"
